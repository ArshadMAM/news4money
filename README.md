Hello random Github people and hello prospective employers,


This is my Final Year Project in my University


The project is on using news articles to predict changes in stock prices by using Machine Learning.


Extraction is the code where I extracted data from 2 APIs (newsapi, WorldTradingData).

Amalgamation is where I mix the 2 datasources to obtain a complete dataset for machine learning (INCOMPLETE).

Analysis is where machine learning is applied and better results are tabulated with each iteration (COMING SOON).


Thanks for viewing!
